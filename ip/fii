urlington Route]]|format=PDF|year=1937|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1950s, the federal government began imposing stricter rules for high-speed operation, and expensive advanced signaling was installed along the routes to the Twin Cities, though trains generally traveled a maximum of {{convert|90|to|100|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Unable to keep up with an increasing automobile speeds on an improving road network and other factors that kept passengers away from trains, train ridership declined and the five daily fast trains became unprofitable.

===End of service===
The ''Twin Cities 400'' was the first victim, ending service on July 23, 1963.  The Burlington (later [[Burlington Northern Railroad|Burlington Northern]]) ''Zephyrs'' ended service on April 30, 1971, the same day the depot closed.  The ''Afternoon Zephyr'' was the last train to serve the depot when it departed that evening bound for Minneapolis. At this time, this train was normally combined with the ''Empire Builder'' and ''North Coast Limited'' from Chicago to St. Paul, except on Fridays when it ran as a separate train. Since April 30 was a Friday, the Zephyr had the &quot;honor&quot; of being the last train to depart the station.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Glischinski, eyewitness account at depot on April 30, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;  Amtrak began operating the next day and changed the remaining Twin Cities trains to stop in Minneapolis instead.

The original expensive signaling enabling high speeds was later removed, and the ''Empire Builder'' respects a maximum [[speed limits in the United States (rail)|speed limit]] of {{convert|79|mph|km/h}}, and takes about 8 hours to travel from St. Paul Union Depot to Chicago.

===Restoration and return of passenger service===
[[File:Concourse of the Saint Paul Union Depot during renovation, 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Exterior of the station during renovation]]
Area boosters had long hoped that trains would return to the Union Depot, and plans gathered steam as the [[Blue Line (Minnesota)|Blue Line]] [[light rail]] project in Minneapolis drew toward completion. Planners envisioned the depot being used for a restored Amtrak service along with Metro and Jefferson Lines buses.

A few businesses had occupied the headhouse since the halt of train service in 1971, while the [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) took over the rear of the building. The concourse and waiting room were used for some postal service activities and storage. After lying dormant for several years in the 1970s, the train tracks were removed from the train deck and it was paved with a flat surface. It began to be used for staging [[semi-trailer truck]]s carrying mail to and from the neighboring Downtown St. Paul Central Post Office as well as USPS employee parking. A driveway ramp was sliced into the train deck at the intersection of Kellogg Boulevard and Broadway Street for USPS vehicles. During the restoration, the USPS moved most of the truck operations to a [[bulk mail]] processing center in [[Eagan, Minnesota]], making way for rehabilitation of the depot as a rail hub.

[[File:St Paul Union Depot Waiting Room Opening Day 3.jpg|thumb|left|Grand opening of the newly renovated waiting room]]
In 2005, the Ramsey County Regional Railroad Authority secured funding to renovate the station as an [[intermodal passenger transport|intermodal]] transit hub served by Amtrak trains, [[Metro Transit (Minnesota)|Metro Transit]] light rail, and intercity bus lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;minnesota.publicradio.org&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2012/12/08/regional/union-depot-reopening/|title=Party marks reopening of St. Paul's Union Depot|last=Shenoy|first=Rupa|website=minnesota.cbslocal.com|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|date=December 8, 2012|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;minnesota.cbslocal.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/12/08/thousands-visit-st-pauls-newly-renovated-union-depot/|title=Thousands Visit St. Paul’s Newly Renovated Union Depot|last=Melo|first=Frederick|website=minnesota.cbslocal.com|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|date=December 8, 2012|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;stpauluniondepot.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stpauluniondepot.com/st-paul-depot-renovation/|title=Renovation|website=www.stpauluniondepot.com|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, the Ramsey County Board approved purchasing the depot headhouse for $8.2 million, to serve as a [[Green Line (Minnesota)|METRO Green Line]] [[light rail]] station and for future passenger rail use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St. Paul Union Depot purchase approved|url=http://www.railwayage.com//content/view/907/121/|work=[[Railway Age]]|date=June 4, 2009|accessdate=June 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demolition of the Postal Service building that blocked track access to the station began in mid-March 2011. The USPS ramp cut all the way across the train deck and blocked the ability for tracks to be installed, so the ramp was modified during restoration to make a roughly right-angle turn to access new bus platforms on the north end of the train deck while freeing up room for a few tracks to be restored on the south end.

The renovation was completed in late November 2012 at a cost of $243 million, of which $35 million was provided by the US government through the [[Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery|TIGER]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progressiverailroading.com/news/article/USDOT-approves-TIGER-grant-agreement-for-Minnesotas-Union-Depot--25091|title=USDOT approves TIGER grant agreement for Minnesota's Union Depot|website=www.progressiverailroading.com|publisher=Progressive Railroading|date=November 18, 2010|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renovated station re-opened to the public on December 8, 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;minnesota.publicradio.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;minnesota.cbslocal.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;stpauluniondepot.com&quot;/&gt;

The current vision for the depot is to create a hub for intercity connections for [[Metro Transit (Minnesota)|local &amp; regional bus service]], [[light rail]], and [[commuter rail]].

The first Amtrak train to service Saint Paul Union Depot was the westbound ''Empire Builder'' which stopped at the station at 11:30pm on May 7, 2014, 70 minutes late heading en route to [[Seattle]] and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]. Officials welcomed the first passengers to depart the train at the depot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.twincities.com/localnews/ci_25716518/amtraks-arrival-at-union-depot-celebrated/|title=After 43 years, St. Paul's Union Depot marks return of passenger trains|last=Melo|first=Fredrick|website=twincitiespress.com|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|date=May 7, 2014|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special Events===
[[File:Milwaukee Road 261 - North Pole Express.JPG|thumb|Milwaukee Road 261 decorated as the North Pole Express in 2014 at St. Paul Union Depot]]
Since opening in late 2012,&lt;ref name=&quot;minnesota.publicradio.org&quot;/&gt; the Depot has hosted a number of events. On May 10, 2014 ([[National Train Day]]), the depot hosted [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] Historical Society's SD45 #400 (Hustle Muscle) from the [[Jackson Street Roundhouse]], as well as some historical equipment. Amtrak displayed three Superliner cars. There were several other displays around the Depot grounds.

In December 2014, for the first time in nearly 50 years, an active steam locomotive returned to St. Paul Union Depot. [[Milwaukee Road 261]] and some historic passenger cars, decorated as the &quot;North Pole Express&quot; ran short excursions to and from the depot. It was determined to be an overwhelming success, with intentions to operate the train again in 2015. While Milwaukee Road 261 was present, the Depot also got a visit from Canadian Pacific's traveling Holiday Train.

On May 9, 2015, the depot hosted National Train Day events once more, with GN SD45 #400 from the Great Northern Railway Historical Society and Jackson Street Roundhouse, plus a newer [[GE ES44C4]] and some of the Milwaukee Road 261 excursion cars.

===Light rail===
The [[METRO (Minnesota)|METRO]] [[Green Line (Minnesota)|Green Line]] light rail line's eastern terminus at the station opened on June 14, 2014, with its final eastern stop in front of the headhouse, rather than at a platform under the waiting room. Utility relocation work in preparation for the Green Line began in front of the depot on 4th Street in August 2009, well before the line received final funding or approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2010/08/20/lowertown-light-rail-construction/|title=St. Paul's Lowertown dealing with light rail construction headaches|last=Yuen|first=Laura|website=minnesota.publicradio.com|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|date=August 10, 2010|accessdate=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Track was laid from 2011–2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Construction Update: Downtown St. Paul - Week of September 20, 2010|url=http://myemail.constantcontact.com/Project-Construction-Update---Downtown-St--Paul---Week-of-September-20--2010.html?soid=1102549393035&amp;aid=8wuAWU1DAF8|website=myemail.constantcontact.com|publisher=Central Corridor Light Rail Transit|date=September 2010|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Union Depot is the eastern terminus of service, the tracks continue beyond the station to the line's maintenance facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrocouncil.org/transportation/ccorridor/construction/CCLRTConstructionScheduleAtAGlance.htm|title=Central Corridor LRT construction schedule at a glance|work=Central Corridor|publisher=Metropolitan Council|date=July 20, 2010|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amtrak===
Serving this station is the ''[[Empire Builder]]'', named to honor Saint Paul-based mogul [[James J. Hill]] who constructed the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railroad]], and whose nickname was &quot;The Empire Builder&quot;. Westbound trains head for [[Spokane, Washington]] and split there to serve both [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Portland, Oregon]]; eastbound trains head for [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]. Previously trains stopped at [[Midway (Amtrak station)]]. Service at Union Depot was delayed for almost two years after the initial grand re-opening due to negotiations with the owners of the railroads in the area&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilbert&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mprnews.org/story/2014/04/02/news/amtrak-union-depot|title=Amtrak sets May 7 return to St. Paul's Union Depot|last=Gilbert|first=Curtis|website=www.mprnews|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|date=April 2, 2014|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the construction of new complex signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.twincities.com/cityhallscoop/2013/01/14/amtraks-arrival-delayed-union-depot-welcomes-jefferson-bus-lines-whose-chair-now-runs-mndot/|title=Amtrak’s arrival delayed.

===Greyhound===
Also serving this station is [[Greyhound Lines]] which arrived at Saint Paul Union Depot in March 2014 after initially pulling out of the project two years prior. Greyhound offers at least six coach bus departures a day and additional weekend service.

===Jefferson Lines===
Serving this station is also [[Jefferson Lines]] which relocated from Midway Station to Saint Paul Union Depot in 2013.

===Other Services===
Other services include [[Megabus (North America)|Megabus]] and the regional [[Metro Transit (Minnesota)|Metro Transit]] and [[Minnesota Valley Transit Authority|MVTA]] transit lines.

==Planned Services==

===Regional rail===
Future service could include commuter trains of the [[Red Rock Corridor]], and the [[Rush Line]] and [[Gateway Corridor (Minnesota)|Gateway Corridor]] if commuter rail and/or light rail are chosen for these corridors. In 2010, the [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] also released a plan for regional rail stretching out from the Twin Cities to rural Minnesota and neighboring states, and at least some of the lines would run to Saint Paul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.state.mn.us/planning/railplan/files/DraftSRPFinalReport.pdf|title=Minnesota Comprehensive Statewide Freight and Passenger Rail Plan (Draft Final Report)|date=December 2009|author=Cambridge Systematics, Inc., Kimley Horn and Associates, Inc., and TKDA, Inc.|publisher=[[Minnesota Department of Transportation]]|accessdate=February 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High-speed rail===
New trains running at speeds above {{convert|100|mph|km/h}} to Chicago have also been discussed since at least 1991.  The [[Midwest Regional Rail Initiative]] (MWRRI), led by the [[Wisconsin Department of Transportation]], has proposed a link to the Twin Cities running at up to {{convert|110|mph|abbr=on}}.  The planned schedule time to Saint Paul would be just 5½ hours.  Others including the French national railway [[SNCF]], which operates the [[TGV]] network, have proposed trains running at up to {{convert|220|mph|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;sncf-midwest&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/sncf/Midwest.pdf|title=Midwest|date=September 14, 2009|publisher=SNCF|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2009/09/19/breaking-sncf-proposes-development-of-high-speed-rail-in-midwest-texas-florida-and-california-corridors/|title=SNCF Proposes Development of High-Speed Rail in Midwest, Texas, Florida, and California Corridors|last=Freemark|first=Yonah|work=The Transport Politic|date=September 19, 2009|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zip Rail]] is a proposed HSR project to connect [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester]] with the Twin Cities including a stop in the St. Paul Union Depot.

==Local significance==
Prior to the station's reopening in December 2012, Josh Collins, a spokesperson for Ramsey County Regional Rail Authority, referred to the potential of the station to be &quot;the living room of Saint Paul.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Duchschere new day&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Duchschere|first=Kevin|title=A new day is coming for St. Paul's Union Depot|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/stpaul/182112301.html?page=all&amp;prepage=1&amp;c=y&amp;refer=y|accessdate=December 5, 2012|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|date=December 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
[[File:St Paul Union Depot Waiting Room Steam Locomotive Frieze.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frieze]] detailing on the waiting room walls]]
The entrance to Union Depot, the [[headhouse]], is considered a somewhat severe example of [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] [[architecture]], with a robust aesthetic.  A series of tall Doric columns line the front façade.  The [[concourse]] and the waiting room that extends out to the platforms, where trains once rolled in, is considered to be one of the great architectural achievements in the city.  The building was designed by Charles Frost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duchschere new day&quot;/&gt;

The waiting room is flooded with natural light from skylights.  These skylights were blackened during the [[Second World War]], but restored for the 2012 re-opening.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duchschere new day&quot;/&gt;

The building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Duchschere new day&quot;/&gt; in 1974.

The restoration and new addition was designed by Hammel Green and Abrahamson Architects &amp; Engineers (HGA).

===Railway mapping===
Milepost for rail lines that originated in Saint Paul use the depot as milepost 0. This is still evident in timetables and mileposts used by the BNSF Railway.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The '''Fremont Bridge''' is a steel [[tied-arch bridge]] over the [[Willamette River]] located in [[Portland, Oregon]].  It carries [[Interstate 405 (Oregon)|Interstate 405]] and [[U.S. Route 30 (Oregon)|US 30]] traffic between downtown and North Portland where it intersects with [[Interstate 5 (Oregon)|I-5]]. It has the longest main span of any bridge in [[Oregon]] and is the second longest tied-arch bridge in the world (after [[Caiyuanba Bridge]] across the [[Yangtze River]], [[China]]).&lt;ref name = &quot;Wood-Wortman&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last= Wood | first= Sharon |author2=Wortman, Ed | title = The Portland Bridge Book | edition = 3rd | publisher = Urban Adventure Press  | year = 2006 | pages = 23–30 | isbn= 0-9787365-1-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge was designed by [[Parsons Brinckerhoff|Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade and Douglas]] and built by Murphy Pacific Corporation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bottenberg&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Bottenberg| first =Ray| title =Bridges of Portland| publisher =Arcadia Publishing| series =| volume =| edition =| date =2007| location =| pages =105-116| language =| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=laTfY36RfY0C&amp;pg=PA105| doi =| id =| isbn =9780738548760| mr =| zbl =| jfm =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bridge has two decks carrying vehicular traffic, each with four lanes.  The upper deck is signed westbound on US 30 and southbound on I-405.  The lower deck is signed eastbound on US 30 and northbound on I-405.

==Design and construction==
Due to the public's dissatisfaction with the appearance of the [[Marquam Bridge]], the Portland Art Commission was invited to participate in the design process of the Fremont.  The improvement in visual quality resulted in a bridge that was nearly six times as expensive as the purposely-economical Marquam Bridge.  Designers modeled the bridge after the original 1964 [[Port Mann Bridge]] in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]].

The steel tie-girder ([[I-beam]]) is 18-feet tall and 50-in wide. On October 28, 1971, while still under construction, a six-foot-long crack was found on the west span of this girder that required a $5.5&amp;nbsp;million redesign and repair. The ramps and approaches are steel [[Box girder bridge|box girders]]. If the lanes of the bridge were placed end-to-end, there are 3.27 lane-miles on the arch bridge and 14.12 lane-miles on the ramps and approaches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bottenberg&quot; /&gt;

The center span of the bridge, where the rib of the arch is above the deck, is 902 feet long.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bottenberg&quot; /&gt; It was fabricated in [[California]] then assembled at [[Overlook, Portland, Oregon|Swan Island]], {{convert|1.7|mi|km}} downstream.&lt;ref name = &quot;Wood-Wortman&quot; /&gt;  After assembly it was floated on a [[barge]] the 1.7 mile trip to the construction site.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bottenberg&quot; /&gt; On March 16, 1973, the 6,000-ton steel arch span was lifted {{convert|170|ft|m|abbr=on}} using 32 [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] jacks.

The bridge was opened on November 15, 1973,&lt;ref name=opens&gt;&quot;Fremont Bridge opens with wheeze&quot;.

==Falcon nest==
The Fremont Bridge was also the 26th [[Peregrine falcon]] nest site designated in Oregon in 1995 after the raptor was placed on the U.S. Threatened and [[Endangered Species]] list in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Audubon Society of Portland | title = Fremont Bridge Peregrines: A Decade of Successful Nesting |url = http://www.audubonportland.org/issues/endangered-species/peregrine-falcon/portland-peregrines/fremont | accessdate = January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The bridge as well as Portland's associated Fremont Street were named for [[John C. Fremont]] (1813–1890). Fremont was an early explorer of the [[Oregon Country]]. He served in the [[United States Army]] at the time as a captain and later promoted to general. In 1856, he ran for president, but was defeated by [[James Buchanan]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Eugene E..

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[United States]] [[law]], the '''Bradley Amendment''' (1986, Public law 99-509, {{USC|42|666}}(a)(9)(c),&lt;!-- fit the title in somehow: Requirement of statutorily prescribed procedures to improve effectiveness of child support enforcement --&gt; [[Bill Bradley]]) requires state courts to prohibit retroactive reduction of [[child support]] obligations. Specifically, it:
* automatically triggers a non-expiring lien whenever child support becomes past-due.
* overrides any state's [[statute of limitations]].
* disallows any judicial discretion, even from bankruptcy judges.
* requires that the payment amounts be maintained without regard for the physical capability of the person owing child support (the ''obligor'') to promptly document [[Child_support#Change_of_circumstances|changed circumstances]] or regard for his awareness of the need to make the notification.

But, like any other past-due debt, the obligee, typically a mother, may forgive what is owed to her.

When past-due child support is owed to a state as a result of welfare paid out, the state is free to forgive some or all of it under what's known as an &quot;offer in compromise&quot;.

==History==
The amendment text was included in the Sixth Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, 1986, bill S.2706.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Weimer|first=Douglas Reid|title=THE BRADLEY AMENDMENT: PROHIBITION AGAINST RETROACTIVE MODIFICATION OF CHILD SUPPORT ARREARAGES
|url=http://congressionalresearch.com/RS20642/document.php?study=THE+BRADLEY+AMENDMENT+PROHIBITION+AGAINST+RETROACTIVE+MODIFICATION+OF+CHILD+SUPPORT+ARREARAGES|publisher=Congressional Research Service|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LOC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=S.2706 All Information|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d099:SN02706:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp;|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Subtitle C: Miscellaneous Provisions''' - Amends part D (Child Support) of title IV of the Act to prohibit the retroactive modification of child support arrearages except with respect to such arrearages which accumulate after the obligee and entity which is issued the child support order receive notice that the obligor has pending an active application for modification of such order.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOC&quot;/&gt;
Senator [[Bill Bradley]], Democrat of New Jersey, introduced the amendment in an earlier bill on May 5, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S.2404 : A bill to amend part D of title IV of the Social Security Act to prohibit the retroactive modification of child support arrearages. |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d099:S2404: |publisher=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It passed in the Senate with amendments with an 88-7 yea-nay vote on September 20, 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOC&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- when was this signed into law? --&gt;

==Intent==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
The amendment was intended to correct a perceived imbalance between the power of the obligee (usually the mother) and the obligor (usually the father) during subsequent child support disputes.  It had been alleged that a significant number of men were running up large child support debts and then finding a sympathetic judge, often in another state, to erase them.

==Results==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
The Bradley Amendment is credited with increases in the collections success of wealthy debtors including a [[New York]] [[cosmetic surgery|plastic surgeon]] who owed $172,000, a professional [[sportsperson|athlete]] who owed $76,000 and a yacht company owner who owed $50,000.&lt;!-- according to an article in Government Executive magazine -- I added this but is that really necessary detail? --&gt; The Bradley Amendment standardizes the treatment of interstate child support disputes (estimated at 40% of all cases according to Geraldine Jensen, president of the [[Association for Children for Enforcement of Support]]).

According to Sherri Z. Heller, Ed.D, Commissioner of U.S. Office of Child Support Enforcement, the child support system collects &quot;about 58% of current support due.&quot;  The US Department of Health and Human Services estimates that 68% of child support cases had arrearages owed in 2003 (a figure up from 53% in 1999 - however this information is based on data supplied only by the custodial parent so it be viewed with extreme doubt).  Some believe that the process can never collect the full amount because a high proportion of obligors are unable to make the required payments.  According to Ford Foundation Project Officer Ronald B. Mincy, between 16 percent and 33 percent of obligors are &quot;[[Deadbeat parent|turnip dads]]&quot; (obligors earning less than $130 a week). According to one study 38% of non-custodial parents not paying child-support said they lacked the money to pay.

: The Health and Human Services numbers above omit closed cases. Typically, cases are closed after four years of inactivity. Open or closed, past-due child support automatically triggers a non expiring lien.

==Legality==
In September 1999, [[Marilyn Ray Smith]], the Chief Legal Counsel for the '''Massachusetts Department of Revenue, Child Support Enforcement Division''' gave the following testimony&lt;ref name=&quot;Marilyn Ray Smith's testimony United States House of Representatives&quot;&gt;Marilyn Ray Smith's testimony before the '''United States House of Representatives''' (September 1999) [http://WaysAndMeans.House.GOV/legacy/humres/106cong/9-23-99/9-23smit.htm Marilyn Ray Smith's testimony]&lt;/ref&gt; before the [[United States House of Representatives]].
&lt;blockquote&gt; As you know, under the Bradley Amendment enacted by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] in 1986, a child support obligation becomes a judgment [[by operation of law]] as of the date that that it is due and unpaid.  In addition, under Section 368 of PRWORA ({{USC|42|666(a)(4)}}), an administrative lien also arises by operation of law against any unpaid child support.  It is therefore not necessary to return to court after each payment is missed to get past-due support reduced to a judgment in order to obtain a lien or enforce a judgment. This means that a child support agency can move quickly to seize income and assets of a delinquent noncustodial parent without first passing through a judicial or [[Quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial]] hearing process.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From 2004, the Bradley Amendment was challenged as unconstitutional and was the subject of a repeal effort; in February 2006 the court case was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.yahoo.com/anniversary-bradley-amendment-continues-child-support-discussion-192300497.html|title=Anniversary of Bradley Amendment Continues Child Support Discussion |first=Killeen |last=Gonzalez|work=[[Yahoo News]] |date=April 27, 2011}}&lt;!-- cites this as source: http://web.archive.org/web/20101111224117/http://www.divorcenet.com/resources/divorce/for-men/the-bradley-amendment-how-does-it-affect-mens-child-support --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 10, 2013, a petition was posted on the Obama administration's [[We the People (petitioning system)|We the People]] website to &quot;stop&quot; the Bradley Amendment, on the grounds that it was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://wh.gov/7Srv |date=March 10, 2013 |author=C.J. |title=WE PETITION THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO: Stop the unconstitutional 1986 Bradley Amendment which makes retroactive child support modification illegal. |work=[[We the People (petitioning system)|We the People]]}}&lt;!-- full link: https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/stop-unconstitutional-1986-bradley-amendment-which-makes-retroactive-child-support-modification/H5drndPK --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

In 2003, Keith McLeod, author of ''The Multiple Scandals of Child Support'', testified&lt;ref name=&quot;Keith McLeod's testimony before the United States House Committee on Ways and Means&quot;&gt;[http://ftp.resource.org/gpo.gov/hearings/108h/90270.pdf Keith McLeod's testimony before the '''United States House Committee on Ways and Means'''] (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; before the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means]] that
&lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;The 1986 Bradley Amendment to Title IV-D forbids any reduction of arrearage or retroactive reduction for any reason, ever. This reinforces the approach that inability to pay is no excuse. Needless to say, there are endless stories of men who are now crushed by a debt they will never be able to pay because they were:
* In a coma
* A captive of Saddam Hussein during the first Gulf War
* In jail
* Medically incapacitated
* Lost their job but were confident of another so did nothing until it was too late
* Did not know they could not ask for retroactive adjustments and waited too long
* Could not afford a lawyer to seek adjustment when adjustment was warranted
* Wouldn’t use the legal system even if they could, feeling it alien from their world, so don’t ask for a reduction when the legal establishment expects them to.
Some say this measure is a violation of due process and cruel and unusual as it removes the use of human discretion from dealing with individual cases, not to mention removing human compassion. But non-custodial fathers do not have the money to fight a constitutional case.&quot; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Notable cases===
The Amendment has been a controversial law and has resulted in several notorious examples:
* Bobby Sherrill, a Lockheed employee in [[Kuwait]] from North Carolina, was captured by Iraqis and spent nearly five months as an [[Iraq]]i [[hostage]]. Sherrill was arrested the night after his release for not paying $1,425 in child support while he was a hostage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://militaryparents.org/dt_gs_families_and_the.php |title=Families and the War |first1=Dianna |last1=Thompson |first2=Glenn |last2=Sacks |work=[[Washington Times]] |date=November 21, 2002 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050413100236/http://militaryparents.org/dt_gs_families_and_the.php |archivedate=2005-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WT_1999&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://ancpr.com/bradleywtarticle.htm |title=Child-support-law amendment comes to attention of Hill; Provision revision could end to horror stories |work=[[The Washington Times]] |first=Cheryl |last= Wetzstein |date=April 27, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FFT2001&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://ww2.fairfaxtimes.com/cms/archivestory.php?id=131380 |title=Child support law is challenged |date=February 20, 2001 |first=Bobby |last=Olinger |work=Fairfax Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://amconmag.com/article/2005/oct/24/00017/ |date=October 24, 2005 |first=Stephen |last=Baskerville |title=The Father's War |work=[[The American Conservative]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Hoshin Engi'''''|封神演義|Hōshin Engi|lead=yes}}, also known as '''''Soul Hunter''''', is a Japanese [[manga]] series by [[Ryu Fujisaki]].
''Hoshin Engi'' was inspired by the [[Chinese literature|Chinese literary]] classic ''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]'', a ''[[shenmo]]'' [[novel]]. The story involves the [[Chinese mythology]] and [[history of China]], in particular the last members of the In (Yin Dynasty aka [[Shang Dynasty]]) and the plot to overthrow them.

The manga series was serialized in ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'' magazine from 1996–2000 and compiled in 23 [[tankōbon]] volumes by [[Shueisha]]. [[VIZ Media]] acquired the rights to the manga, with bimonthly releases starting June 5, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/article.php?id=9256 Viz acquires rights to Hoshin Engi], [[Anime News Network]]&lt;/ref&gt; Also of note is that the manga has been re-released and re-compiled into fewer larger volumes with new cover art, illustrations and afterwords. The 18 [[Kanzenban]] volumes were released periodically between July 2005 and June 2006 in Japan only.

The story has been adapted into an [[anime]] series titled ''Senkai-den Hōshin Engi'', broadcast on Japanese TV in 1999 and released in North America on DVD as ''Soul Hunter'' in 2001.  The anime is 26 episodes in length. In January 2009, Shomei TV announced their intentions to remake the anime series if they received 10,000 signatures. Although the 10,000 signatures were reached, there's been no word about the remake as of April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shomei.tv/project-595.html |script-title=ja:アニメ仙界伝 封神演義復活運動 - 署名活動するなら『署名ＴＶ』 |language=Japanese |publisher=Shomei.tv |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characters from the series appear in [[Jump Ultimate Stars]]. The plot and characters are described, below, using in-universe tone.

==Plot==
The story is set in legendary China. A beautiful female [[Huli jing|fox spirit]] named {{nihongo|[[Daji|Dakki]]|妲己}} is controlling the emperor {{nihongo|[[King Zhou of Shang|Chu-o]]|紂王|''Chū-ō}} and the ruling  [[Shang Dynasty|In (殷)]] dynasty, and is using her power over him to do evil in the nation.  An immortal-in-training named {{nihongo|[[Jiang Ziya|Taikobo]]|太公望|''Taikōbō}} is chosen by the great immortal sages for the Houshin Project (封神計画) &amp;mdash; to seal away or destroy the evil demons that infest the world.  In the course of his adventures, Taikobo gathers other powerful companions and sets out to seal away the demons and eventually destroy the fox-spirit Dakki.

There are significant plot differences between the novel, the manga series and the anime.

===Manga plot===
The 23 manga book series follows the adventures of Taikobo and his trusty {{nihongo|&quot;Rei-jū&quot;|霊獣}} ('Spirit Beast' or 'Sacred Beast') [[Père David's Deer|Sū-pū-shan (四不像)]]. Taikobo was given a mission by [[Yuanshi Tianzun|Genshi-tenson (元始天尊)]] (Taikobou's mentor and the leader of the [[Xian (Taoism)|Sennin (仙人)]] World - [[Kunlun Mountain|Konron (崑崙)]]) to complete the Houshin Project.

The goal of the Hoshin Project, as explained by Genshitenson, is to trap Dakki and her minions in a 'middle' world between the Sennin World and the Human world, renamed {{nihongo|'Shin'|神}} (Deity or Gods) World, named 'Shinkai', Realm of the Gods. Taikobo's mission is to hunt down the 365 people whose names were written on the Hoshin Scroll. As Taikobo defeats and seals off each of the 365 people on the scroll, their souls are instantly transported to the Hoshindai (a floating island made to trap souls) and sealed there until all the 365 souls are gathered.

At first, Taikobo refused to take up such a troublesome mission, but when threatened with expulsion from Konron, he quickly relented. After that, he was given a {{nihongo|Pao-pei|宝貝}}, {{nihongo|Whip of the Gods|打神鞭|Dashinben}} (in Chinese literally &quot;Gods-Hitting Whip&quot;), as his weapon along with Supushan.

Upon leaving Konron, Taikobou and Supushan immediately met up with the first person listed on the Houshin Scroll, the all-powerful Shinkouhyou (申公豹) and his Riding Beast - Kokutenko (黒点虎). After a short battle between the two {{nihongo|Doushi|道師}}, in which Taikoubou was easily defeated, Taikoubou suspected that the order of the Houshin Scroll is sorted according to strength (Shinkouhyou being the first on the list) and decides to avoid fighting him. Aiming for the core of the whole problem, he enters the capital, Chouka and defeating one of Dakki's sisters, Ou Kijin (who reverted to her original form, a stone lute), he used her to enter the service of the emperor in order to spot Dakki's weakness. Furious with her sister's plight, Dakki contrives a plan to reclaim her sister. Taikoubou, overwhelmed by her guile, was defeated and was about to be thrown into the taibon (a pit full of poisonous snakes) along with some of the Kyou clan, when during a commotion caused by them, Buuseiou Ko Hiko saved him. It was then that he came to a realization that there was no way he could take on Dakki and her followers, on his own. That's why he set off searching for strong fighters to join him on his quest to rid the world of Dakki. Taikoubou soon met up and joined forces with [[Nezha (deity)|Nataku (哪吒)]], [[:ja:雷震子|Raishinshi (雷震子)]], Kou-Tenka (黄天化) and [[Erlang Shen|Youzen (楊戩)]].

As the series progresses, Taikobo slowly realises that there is no hope in disrupting Dakki's strangle hold on the Yin Dynasty or her influence over Chuuou. As such, he abandoned the kingdom and requested that [[King Wen of Zhou|Ki Shō (姫昌)]] form a new Monarchy to rival the Yin, renamed the [[Zhou Dynasty|Shū Dynasty (周)]] with their new emperor - [[King Wu of Zhou|Bu-ou (武王)]], who is the second son of Ki Hatsu who had died due to self-starvation caused by Dakki serving him his son as a hamburger during his capture. Taikoubou then became the military advisor to Zhou, helping the Western Army conquer the lands once owned by Yin.

Bunchū (聞仲), the senior advisor to the emperor Chū-ou in the country of Yin and also a pao-pei user, sees Taikoubou as an obstacle and sends out some of his best Doushi companions to attack Taikoubou and company. The ensuing fights between the two groups eventually lead to the involvement of almost all members of the 2 Sennin Worlds - Konron (where Taikoubou originates) and {{nihongo|Kingou-tou|金鰲島}} (where Bunchuu learnt his arts). At the climax of the Senn
